[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:43 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsrdfdom.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "srdfdom", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "srdfdom" with any
  of the following names:

    srdfdomConfig.cmake
    srdfdom-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "srdfdom" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "srdfdom_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "srdfdom" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
