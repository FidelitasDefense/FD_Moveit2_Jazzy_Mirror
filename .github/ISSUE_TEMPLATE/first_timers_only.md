## Background

Please write an overview of your issue here.

## Instructions

Hi, this is a `first-timer-only` issue. This means we've worked to make it more legible to people who either **haven't contributed to our codebase before or even folks who haven't contributed to open source before**.

We're interested in helping you take the first step, and can answer questions and help you out along the way. Note that we're especially interested in contributions from underrepresented groups!

We know that creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you.

If you have contributed before, **please consider leaving this PR for someone new**, and looking through our general [bug](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/labels/bug) issues. Thanks!

## What Should you Know?

Nothing. This issue is meant to welcome you to Open Source :). We are happy to walk you through the process.

## Step by Step Process

* **Claim this Issue:** Comment below. If someone else has claimed it, ask if they've opened a pull request already and if they're stuck, maybe you can help them solve a problem or move it along!

* **Create a Local Workspace:** For making your changes and testing [following these instructions](https://moveit.ros.org/install/source/).

* **Fork the Repository:** Using the handy button at the top of the repository page and **clone** it into `~/ws_moveit/src/moveit`, [here is a guide that you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (You will have to remove or empty the existing `moveit` folder before cloning your own fork).

* **Update:** Please update the file(s) `$FILENAME` by applying the change shown in the diff below.

```diff
$DIFF
```

* **Apply `clang-format-14`** auto formatting, [following these instructions](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute_to_site.html):

* **Commit and Push:** Commit and Push Your Changes

* **Start a Pull Request (ðŸ”€): ** To request to merge your code into `master`. There are two ways that you can start a pull request:
1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.
2. If you are familiar with the terminal or would like to learn to use it, [here is a great tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) on how to send a pull request using the terminal.

* **Done:** Please ask for reviews in comments for better understanding.

### Is Someone Else Already Working on This?
